<h3>1. Start young.</h3>
 
I believe that everyone have heard about compound interest and its power by now. Great illustration of it is given to us by futurama:

Fry was frozen for 1000 years and starting with only $1 on his account he has accrued $4.5B. Most of us will not live 1000 years, or get frozen, but we still have good couple of years for our investments to grow.

Btw. according to some Internet sources, Warren Buffet bought his first stock when he was 11 years old… o.O  

<h3>2. Think long-term.</h3>




Matthew said it best in the Wolf of Wall Street:

Nobody knows if the stock is going up, down or fugazi. But what Matthew does not tell us is that in the long-term the market is somewhat predictable and if you are holding a diversified (wow, the key word - diversified) portfolio of assets you are going to make money in the long-term. 

<h3>3. Create a habit.</h3>

The markets are volatile and in the short-term everyone has of taking a risky bet and becoming rich, but the real secret is to get rich slow, that’s how you appreciate it:

Therefore, you need to create a habit of saving and investing. Try setting aside some of the money from every paycheck and try to invest some of it too! The sooner you do that the more props for you (compound interest baby!).

<h3>4. Invest only Your surplus funds.</h3>

Look, the thing is that if you need to pay back credit, pay for an operation of a kidney or feel like you need a trip around of the world because you are becoming depressed, you should not invest funds that you want to spend for those expenses. 

We are transparent and we care for you, thus we know that sometimes it is better for you to pay back the credit instead of investing the money because it should be a priority. 

Aaaand also because of black fridays, gray mondays and #434547 tuesdays on capital markets:

<h3>5. Diversify!!</h3>

I hear that word everyday at least 100 times. Also this is the amount of different assets you should invest in - 100.

Anchorman said it best:

Uupps, wrong clip, but well, we gonna work with what we have. 

We believe in both diversification of assets and diversity in society and workplaces. While, diversification allows you to lower the risk you are taking with each investment, hanging out with diverse people makes you a better human.
